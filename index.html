					<h1>WELCOME</h1>
					
					<p> 
							Hello, my name is Cyril and it is a pleasure to welcome you. This website has for first objective to be my training in the learning of HTML and CSS language which are the basis of web pages creation. However, the idea of being able to exchange and share on this space is a good occasion for me. You will find here a lot of useful information for people wanting to know a little more about me or my professional life.  You will also find some tutorials or methods on different stuff I made.
							</p> 

							<p>
							We live in a fantastic era. Internet is a stupendous tool to learn and share. However this technology that make our life easier reduces individual power (the capacity of doing things by ourselves). I wanted to learn and understand a bit more about how it works and how to create my own website or applications and I would like to thanks M. Mathieu Nebra creator of <a href="http://Openclassroom.com">Openclassroom.com</a> which offers free lessons on many domain to satisfy my insatiable curiosity.
							</p>
					
					<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
					<p>
							First of all I like to learn how to make things. I am interested in almost everything and my curiosity is my principal strength. I like to discover new ideas, learn new techniques, develop new skills, meet new people and experiment new ways of thinking. I'd rather spend time and even "waste time" to do something myself by learning and understanding than simply buying it. 
							</p> <p>
							I have done all my studies in science, driven by the will of understanding the world. When I was young I wanted to be an astronaut and I did not give up on this dream yet, but even if I end up doing something else, there is so much people to learn from and things to see in this world for my life to be boring.
							</p>
